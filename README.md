Non-modifying sequence algorithms, are algorithms that do noy modify the sequence of elements they operate on.
These include algorithms for searching elements in a range and for comparing two ranges to each other;
They also include a number of counting algorithms.

Search algorithms, these algorithms do not require the sequence to be sorted. N is the size of the sequence
to search in, and M is the size of the pattern to find.

Comparison algorithms.

Modifying sequence algorithms, mofify some or all of the elements in a sequence. Some of them modify elements in 
place so that the original sequence changes. Others copy the results to a different sequence so that the original
sequebce remains unchanger. All of them have a linear worst-case complexity.

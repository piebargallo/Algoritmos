Non-modifying sequence algorithms, are algorithms that do noy modify the sequence of elements they operate on.
These include algorithms for searching elements in a range and for comparing two ranges to each other;
They also include a number of counting algorithms.

Search algorithms, these algorithms do not require the sequence to be sorted. N is the size of the sequence
to search in, and M is the size of the pattern to find.

Comparison algorithms. These algorithms have the advantage that you can compare sequences from different containers.

Modifying sequence algorithms, mofify some or all of the elements in a sequence. Some of them modify elements in 
place so that the original sequence changes. Others copy the results to a different sequence so that the original
sequebce remains unchanger. All of them have a linear worst-case complexity.

Partition algorithms, a sequence is partitioned on  acertain predicate, if all elements for wich the predicate
returns true are before all elements for wich it returns false. The first element in the sequence that does
not satisfy the predicate is called the particular point.

Binary search algoritms, that work only sequences that are sorted or that are at least partitioned on the
element that is searched for.

Sorting algorithms reorders the contents of a container such that an ordering is maintained between sequential
elements of the collection.
